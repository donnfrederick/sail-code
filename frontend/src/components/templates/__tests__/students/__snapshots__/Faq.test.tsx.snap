    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"

      Is it possible for multiple people to use the same account?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      No, each registrant must have an account of their own, so that we may offer the best lesson for each individual.

    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"

      Do I have to use my real name?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      To make sure conversation goes as smoothly as possible, we recommend using your real name. However, you can also use a nickname if you feel your real name is too long to use. Our system security protects your personal information, including your real name.

    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Conversation times depend on what time our Japanese users are available. We will do our best to match your schedule with that of the teachers.

      How does our system work?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Here is our ecosystem:
1. A Japanese person indicates their availability.
2. You select one of their available times.
3. The conversation reservation is made.
4. On the day of the conversation, you and the Japanese person get ready beforehand.
5. You and the Japanese person start the conversation.
6. You and the Japanese person evaluate the conversation (this helps us make improvements to our system).
7. Back to step 1.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2
      className="sc-EHOje zkWQt"
    >
      When can reservations be made?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Reservations can be made whenever. In other words, if they appear when choosing a time, the reservation can be made. However, we recommend that you make reservations well in advance (so that you and your conversation partner have time to prepare).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2
      className="sc-EHOje zkWQt"
    >
      In case I cannot attend a scheduled conversation, can I make an alternative reservation?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      You can reserve another conversation even after a previous one has been cancelled. However, if you forget to cancel a reservation for a conversation you cannot attend, our system will penalize you.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>

      What if I don’t know how to express something in Japanese? What should I do?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Try using another expression that means the same thing.

      Is there a limit to the amount of conversations I can have on this service?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Free trial members have 3 free conversations. Members who are subscribed have no limits on the amount of conversations they can have!

      Can I ask my conversation partner to proofread a document?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Yes, you can ask for a document to be proofread, if your conversation partner accepts. However, we do not allow for business-related documents and contracts to be proofread.
    </p>

      How do I cancel a conversation I’ve already booked?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Conversations that are already scheduled can only be cancelled from the main page at least a day in advance. If you cannot attend a conversation, please cancel as soon as possible.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>

      If I do not attend a conversation, is there a penalty?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      When you don’t attend a conversation, our system penalizes you (your lateness rate is increased). As a result, you will receive less conversation recommendations.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2
      className="sc-EHOje zkWQt"

      I would like to inform my conversation partner that I will not attend the conversation because something urgent came up.
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Once you cancel a conversation, your conversation partner will see that indicated on their account. Please cancel reservations as soon as possible, but note that same-day cancellations are not possible.

      How to start a conversation
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      Be ready for the lesson 5 minutes before it starts. When it is time, click the start button on the reservation's detail page (there will also be a popup dialogue). The video chat with your conversation partner will last for 25 minutes, and once time is up, the conversation will end automatically. This is all according to the time on your device; please make sure that the time on your device is accurate. Otherwise, the video may start and end at incorrect times.

      Can I talk while walking?
    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"
    >
      We highly recommend sitting while talking. Walking while using Sail is dangerous, as your attention will be diverted from walking.

      Check the permissions of your computer / smartphone and browser.
Depending on your device, there are different solutions.
Computer: The first time you use a camera and microphone with Sail on your computer, the browser will ask you (through a popup message)  to grant Sail permission to use these devices. If you missed the message or did not grant permission, a muted camera icon will be visible at the right side of the address bar. The icon will only be visible when Sail is requesting access, so for other cases, please go to your browser settings. There, you can give ‘sail.helte.jp’ the necessary permissions.
Android: On Android, visit the browser settings to give ‘sail.helte.jp’ the necessary permissions.

    </h2>
    <p
      className="sc-bZQynM gkFmQT"

      The stability of the connection depends on the condition of your internet connection. Please try the following solutions:
･  Check that your device is charged.
･ Check that your device is not overheated.
･ Update your browser to the latest version
･ Find another place with better internet connection
･ Try changing between different connection types (WiFi, mobile phone internet, and wired LAN)
･ Schedule at a less busy time.
･ Check that your WiFi chip works properly.

      The quality of the video chat is affected by both your internet connection and device. Please check the question “What are the system requirements?”
Try restarting your browser before the conversation—this will end unnecessary background processes. Also, close all other windows and tabs. To get the best performance, make sure your browser is updated.
